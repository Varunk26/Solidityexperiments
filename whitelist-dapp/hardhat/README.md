# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

//Whitelist contract address - "0xE1b17CCae1cD60A7D9a94Ea75144d3874D053704"
//ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="X75CXCC6AE6N6VNSTUCFGY5MP8AGG7Z438"
NFTCONTRACT = "0xF2a62Df7aDbd25EfA6F9c715704bDDFc4Cb444F7"
