# Solidityexperiments
All of Varun's solidity experiments

* Created a dApp with a front end that interacts with smart contracts
* Created my own ERC20 crypto currency
* Created an NFT contract on the Ethereum network using Hardhat and OpenZeppelin Contracts!
* Launched an NFT Collection named Crypto Devs -It gives early supporters access to the NFT mint when it happens. This is done by building a whitelist dApp first and allowing  early supporters to join the whitelist. Being on the whitelist will give them free access to mint the NFT once your collection launches!
